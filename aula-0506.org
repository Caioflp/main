4. Informally, a set is simply a collection of distinct objects. To
   give a more precise definition we can employ the method of data
   abstraction. That is, we define ``set'' by specifying the
   operations that are to be used on sets. These are union-set,
   intersection-set, element-of-set?, and adjoin-set. (e footnote 37)

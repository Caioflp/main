- equality

  Are D1 and D2 the same? An acceptable answer is yes, because D1 and
  D2 have the same computational behavior -- each is a procedure that
  subtracts its input from 25. In fact, D1 could be substituted for D2
  in any computation without changing the result.

  Even though W1 and W2 are ``equal'' in the sense that they are both
  created by evaluating the same expression, (make-simplified-withdraw
  25), it is not true that W1 could be substituted for W2 in any
  expression without changing the result of evaluating the expression.

  A language that supports the concept that ``equals can be
  substituted for equals'' in an expresssion without changing the
  value of the expression is said to be referentially transparent.

  Consequently, reasoning about programs that use assignment becomes
  drastically more difficult.

- In general, so long as we never modify data objects, we can regard a
  compound data object to be precisely the totality of its pieces. For
  example, a rational number is determined by giving its numerator and
  its denominator. But this view is no longer valid in the presence of
  change, where a compound data object has an ``identity'' that is
  something different from the pieces of which it is composed. A bank
  account is still ``the same'' bank account even if we change the
  balance by making a withdrawal; conversely, we could have two
  different bank accounts with the same state information.

   In working with compound data, we've stressed how data abstraction
   permits us to design programs without becoming enmeshed in the
   details of data representations, and how abstraction preserves for
   us the flexibility to experiment with alternative representations

1. Sec 2.2.3  = conventional interfaces

   The value of expressing programs as sequence operations is that
   this helps us make program designs that are modular, that is,
   designs that are constructed by combining relatively independent
   pieces. We can encourage modular design by providing a library of
   standard components together with a conventional interface for
   connecting the components in flexible ways.
